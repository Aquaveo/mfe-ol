# MFE-OL MicroFrontEnd Module for Tethys Dash

## Wish List

- Need to make the controllers optional: Toggle Layers, and Legend
- Need to allow for multi legend (different services)
- Need to allow to separate the base layer from the other layers

## TroubleShooting

### Common Errors

Webpack not loading the shared module on the ModuleFederation plugin

```bash
_Uncaught Error: Shared module is not available for eager consumption: webpack/sharing/consume/default/react/react_
```
